# How AI Tools Helped in Development

## Overview
AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and AutoGPT played a crucial role in accelerating the development of the AI Task Manager project. These tools assisted in coding, debugging, and optimizing various components of both the backend and frontend systems.

## AI Tools Utilized
### 1. **ChatGPT**
- **API Integration**: Helped in understanding and implementing OpenAI/Gemini API for AI-powered task recommendations.
- **Code Debugging**: Provided insights and fixes for Golang and JavaScript errors.
- **Documentation Assistance**: Generated structured documentation and README files.
- **Architecture Design**: Suggested best practices for structuring the Golang backend and Next.js frontend.

### 2. **GitHub Copilot**
- **Code Autocompletion**: Assisted in writing efficient Golang handlers, middleware, and database queries.
- **Frontend Development**: Suggested reusable React components and Tailwind CSS styling.
- **Optimized Code**: Suggested improvements in API response handling and error handling mechanisms.

### 3. **AutoGPT**
- **Task Breakdown Automation**: Helped generate smart task breakdown structures based on user inputs.
- **Code Refactoring**: Provided suggestions for modularizing backend logic for scalability.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Suggested using Goroutines and WebSockets efficiently for real-time updates.

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow
1. **Initial Planning**
